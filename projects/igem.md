Collaborate at the forefront of digital and bio technology with UVic Virtual and Victoria iGEM - your local virtual reality and genetic engineering university teams. We are working together to build a VR program that will make the invisible visible - a model of genetic replication and protein transcription you can interact with in a computer generated world. This project will be featured in Boston in October 2019 at the annual iGEM Jamboree - a collegiate competition that draws competitors from top universities worldwide.

Programs in use:
Nanome - https://nanome.ai/
Jae's Org Chem program
Tilt Brush

Looking for:
People with experience in world and simulation building (coding or WYSIWYG)
Development for multiple VR platforms
Creative Coders

Once a basic build is running, we have been shortlisted for the Oculus Developer program which will get us free gear, expert mentorship, and a place in a community of VR developers. Lets go!
